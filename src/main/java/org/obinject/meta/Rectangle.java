/**
 * The rectangular domain associates an area, volume or hyper-volume to a key by
 * using Rectangle interface.
 *
 * Point delegates to indexed keys the responsibilities of the serialization,
 * the metric distance calculation, the spatial position definition and the
 * spatial extension.<p/>
 *
 * Serialization can been seen in {@link Key} interface.<p/>
 *
 * Metric distance calculation can been seen in {@link Metric} interface.<p/>
 *
 * Spatial position defines the number of dimensions and the coordinates on each
 * dimension.<p/>
 *
 * Spatial extension defines the size in each dimension (width, height, depth...)
 * .<p/>
 *
 * Rectangles are used as a simplified geometry for line and polygon objects in
 * spatial databases and such representation is referred as Minimum Bounding
 * Rectangle (MBR)
 * .<p/>
 *
 * @param <K> The CRTP parameter is used in method signature that computes the
 * distance.
