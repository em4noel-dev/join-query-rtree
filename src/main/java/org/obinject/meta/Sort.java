/**
 * The ordered domain satisfies the total order relation 
 (transitivity, antisymmetry and totality) by using the Sort 
 interface.<p/>
 
 Sort delegates to indexed keys the responsibilities of the serialization and
 the object ordering.<p/>
 * 
 * Serialization can been seen in {@link Key} interface.<p/>
 * 
 * Object ordering ensures the total order relation. It is implemented 
 * in the {@code compareTo} method, from the Sort interface. This method 
 compares two keys to establish a total order over a set of objects.<p/>
 * 
 * @param <K> The CRTP parameter is used in method signature that 
 * verifies the object ordering.
