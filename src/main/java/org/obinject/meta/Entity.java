/**
 * The persistent entities, extends the user-defined classes 
 * and implements the Entity interface. The extension avoids 
 * modifications in the user-defined classes.<p/>
 * 
 * The Entity implementation provides the methods required for 
 * persistence.<p/>
 * 
 * The Entity delegates to persistent entities the responsibilities: 
 * object serialization, object equivalence, object uniqueness and class 
 * identity.<p/>
 * 
 * Object serialization is performed by using auxiliary classes
 * {@link PushStream} and {@link PullStream}. These classes are used in push and
 * pull methods in order to convert objects to their serialized format.<p/>
 * 
 * Object equivalence checks if two distinct entities have the same 
 * attribute values.<p/>
 * 
 * Object uniqueness is used by the data structure to retrieve 
 * instances of each stored object.<p/>
 * 
 * Class identity is used to ensure that a retrieved object is 
 * indeed an instance of the correct class.<p/>
 * 
 * @param <E> The CRTP parameter is used in method signature that 
 * verifies the object equivalence.
